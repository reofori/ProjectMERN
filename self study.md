__1.__ __Comments:__

Comments serve as annotations for code clarity and documentation. JavaScript supports two comment types:

__Single-line comments:__ 
```javascript
// This is a single-line comment
```

__Multi-line comments:__
```javascript
/*
This is a multi-line
comment
*/
```

__2.__ __Variables:__

Variables act as containers for storing data values. JavaScript offers three variable declaration keywords:

- __var:__ Globally or locally scoped, irrespective of block scope.
- __let:__ Block-scoped variable, allowing reassignment.
- __const:__ Block-scoped variable, immutable after initialization.

Example:
```javascript
var a = 5;
let b = 'Hello';
const c = true;
```

__3.__ __Data Types:__

JavaScript supports various data types:

__Primitive Data Types:__ ```Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null```

__Composite Data Types:__ ```Object, Array```

__Special Data Types:__ ```Function```

Example:
```javascript
let num = 10;
let str = "JavaScript";
let bool = true;
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
let obj = { name: "John", age: 30 };
let func = function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
};
```

__4.__ __Operators:__

JavaScript includes operators for performing operations on variables and values.

__Arithmetic Operators:__ ```+, -, *, /, %```

__Assignment Operators:__ ```=, +=, -=, *=, /=```

__Comparison Operators:__ ```==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=```

__Logical Operators:__ ```&&, ||, !```

__String Operators:__ ```+ (concatenation)```

__Conditional (Ternary) Operator:__ ```condition ? value1 : value2```

Example:
```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = 5;
let z = x + y; // Addition
let result = (x > y) ? "x is greater than y" : "x is less than or equal to y"; // Ternary Operator
```

__5.__ __Control Structures:__

JavaScript provides control structures to manage program flow.

- __Conditional Statements:__ ```if, else if, else```

- __Switch Statement:__ Executes code based on different cases

- __Loops:__ ```for, while, do...while```

Example:
```javascript
let num = 10;
if (num > 0) {
    console.log("Positive number");
} else if (num < 0) {
    console.log("Negative number");
} else {
    console.log("Zero");
}

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
```

__6.__ __Functions:__

Functions encapsulate reusable code blocks. JavaScript functions can be defined using the function keyword.

- __Function Declaration:__ Functions can be called before they are defined.
- __Function Expression:__ Assigning a function to a variable.

Example:
```javascript
// Function Declaration
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

// Function Expression
let greet = function(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
};

console.log(greet("John"));
```

At its core, CSS serves to style web pages, empowering developers to define the visual attributes of HTML elements, encompassing colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. By harnessing CSS, developers can elevate the user experience by crafting visually captivating, coherent, and accessible web pages.

### Basic Syntax
CSS consists of a collection of rules dictating how elements on a web page should be styled. Each rule comprises two primary components:

- __Selector:__ Selectors pinpoint specific HTML elements to which styles will be applied, targeting elements based on tag name, class, ID, or other attributes.
- __Declaration:__ Declarations delineate the styles for the selected elements, with each declaration comprising a property and a value, separated by a colon and terminated with a semicolon.

Example CSS rule:
```bash
selector {
    property: value;
}
```

### Dissecting the Example:

- __selector:__ This can be any valid CSS selector, such as `h1` (targeting all `<h1>` elements) or `.my-class` (targeting elements with the class `my-class`).

- __property:__ Specifies the visual aspect to be styled, like `color`, `font-family`, or `margin`.

- __value:__ Defines the specific value for the chosen property, which can be keywords (e.g., `red`), numerical values (e.g., `10px`), percentages (e.g., `50%`), or predefined constants.

### Properties and Values

CSS offers an extensive array of properties and values for styling elements, including:

- `color`
- `font-family`
- `font-size`
- `background-color`
- `margin`
- `padding`
- `border`
- `width`
- `height`
- `display`

Values for properties can be specified in various formats such as keywords, numerical values, percentages, or predefined constants.

Example:
```bash
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 24px;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    margin: 10px;
    padding: 20px;
    border: 1px solid black;
    width: 300px;
    height: 150px;
    display: block;
}
```

### Conclusion

CSS stands as a fundamental cornerstone of web development, furnishing developers with authority over the visual presentation of web pages.
